    Hey there, I am Nikita

Based in Rajasthan, India. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord server

Tell me more..
<p>

    I kinda started this site to help people find solutions for their tech problems. At that time I wrote articles related to YouTube and some other topics and slowly the site gained momentum and I started to cover more categories. At this time, the site has 3main categories — YouTube, Internet, and Instagram

    (I’ll use “We” Instead of “I” as it looks more friendly, nevertheless I work alone on this site.)
    
    Over time, we’ve received lots of feedback (comments and traffic) which tells noth
</p>ing but one thing, that I must continue doing what I love. It feels really good reading a comment where someone appreciates the article. I feel gratified.
